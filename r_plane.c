// With DOOM style restrictions on view orientation,
//  the floors and ceilings consist of horizontal slices
//  or spans with constant z depth.
// However, rotation around the world z axis is possible,
//  thus this mapping, while simpler and faster than
//  perspective correct texture mapping, has to traverse
//  the texture at an angle in all but a few cases.
// In consequence, flats are not stored by column (like walls),
//  and the inner loop has to step in texture space u and v.
