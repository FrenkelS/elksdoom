ELKSDOOM
DOOM for ELKS
https://github.com/FrenkelS/elksdoom

Doom was originally designed in 1993 for 32-bit DOS computers with 4 MB of RAM.
It's mostly written in C code with very little assembly code.
It has been ported to all kinds of systems.
Usually these systems are 32-bit or more and have a flat memory model.

ELKSDOOM is a port for ELKS.
It's based on Doom8088, a port of Doom for 16-bit DOS computers.
